# Lippmann_Schwinger
Light weight implementation of the Lippmann-Schwinger solver in Matlab

To run the examples, just run the LS_init function while in matlab. This will initialize the folder structure and will allow you to use the object oriented implementation. 

The multiplication and backslash are both overloaded, thus you can solve (using Gmres under the hood) easily the LS equation using this interface.
